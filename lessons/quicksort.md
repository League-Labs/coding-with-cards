title: Quicksort lesson

Quicksort is an efficient way to sort things by breaking the problem down into
smaller parts. You start by picking a "pivot" card. This can be any card, but
choosing one near the middle usually works out better. Then, go through the rest
of the cards and place the ones that are less than the pivot on the left, and
the ones that are greater than the pivot on the right. Make sure to treat those
left and right piles like brand-new problems and repeat the process. Pick a new
pivot for each side, split again, and keep going until each pile is either just
one card or already sorted. To illustrate this with playing cards, lay out a
messy row of cards face up, pick a pivot, and physically move cards to the left
or right depending on their value. Continue repeating this process for the left
and right piles until the entire arrangement is in order. It's a cool visual way
to see a sorting algorithm in action.
