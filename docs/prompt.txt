I want to teach a student the bubble sort, using playing cards. Can you show me
an example of each step of the algorithm, showing cards that are swapped and not
swapped, for each step, starting with these cards:

5 2 8 3 6

Lets show the cards that were compared in yellow. If they are swapped, make them
red. If they were not swapped, blue. And if they are in sorted order, green.

Make this an HTML file, where the number have a colored background to show their
swap-state.

More detailed prompt: 



I would like to teach students the quicksort, and I want you to produce a sample of a quicksort done with cards. Here is an example that we've done for another sort:

Here is the prompt that generated that example:

Please give me another html file for a quicksort that has the same style as the previous sort.
